Thanks to Tobias Oetiker, the author of RRD, for his very useful tool.
Without RRD, Cricket would be useless.

The genDevConfig script is based on the hard work of:

  * MRTG 2.8.8 cfgmaker by Tobias Oetiker 
  * Cricket 0.71 listInterface by Jeff Allen
  * genRtrConfig 1.4 by Mike Fisher
  * genCatConfig 1.4 by Mike Fisher
  * CHIRP 1.0 by ???

It was initially developped and integrated by Mike Fisher, who released the
first public version of genRtrConfig on sourceforge (version 1.4).

The script was further developed under the genRtrConfig name by
Francois Mikus. As the script evolved the name was changed to genDevConfig
to reflect the new scope and mechanics.

This script would not be where it is right now without the involvement of
these fine people, in no particular order.
