# This is intended as a proof of concept for making it compatible with
# other types of configuration profile formats.
#
# - Integrated Cricket log.pm into the genDevConfig package

# - Typo fixes in genDevConfig, CiscoIOS.pm and Sensatronic.pm

27/01/2007

# Version 2_0_0beta14
#
# Major new features
#
# - New CSS1100 cricket plugin
# - New Sensatronics EM1 cricket plugin
# - Support for DS1 serial interface statistics

11/05/2005

# Version 2_0_0beta12
#
# Major new features
#
# - Now uses GetOpts::Long module for args processing. 
#   Much more robust options matching.
# - --nospeedcheck option added
# - Support for greater than gig interfaces
# - Supports multiple plugin matches for a given device
# - Brand new Foundry plugin based on CHIRP ServerIron plugin
# - FIX: NortelAccelar plugin now recognizes devices correctly.
# - Defaults have been cleaned up commented and split by vendor.
#   It should now be much, much easier to understand what is going on!
# - Many, many, many internal changes.

05/05/2005

# Version 2_0_0beta11
#
# Major new features
#
# - added --nomtucheck and nospeedcheck for sanity checking overrides.
# - Cleaned up Debug and Info output to be more readable.
# - various internal changes, see cvs commit info.

# Version 2_0_0beta10
#
# NOTICE! Compatibility with previous version of genDevConfig and genRtrConfig
# has been maintained. Please refrain from using beta9.
#
# Please update all plugins, libraries, defaults and main script. This
# is a major release.
#
# Major new features
# 
# - new option:  -o, --ouputdir Provide the output dir for target being created
# - added dot3stat support check for extended mib stats. (Andrew cutler)
# - modified back-end for --monitors. Will now use cricket config tree
#   monitorType's as definitions for monitor-thresholds. This feature
#   requires the monitorType patch to HandleTarget in sourceforge.
# - added support for non-unicast packets as a command-line option --nucast
#   This will create targets with non-unicast stats if requested. Note that
#   activating this for existing targets will break collection. As two new
#   ds's are required to support this.
# - updated all modules to support the NUcast packet support
# - Deprecated --access and --core options, they will come back under a new
#   form. As they influenced monitor thresholds for identical targetTypes.
# - Changed Defaults, removed all access and core interface targetTypes.
# - Bits and pieces all over the place. ;-)

# Version 2_0_0beta9 !WARNING! DEPRECATED RELEASE DO NOT USE
#
# WARNING! genDevConfig targets are not compatible
# with existing targets.
#
# WARNING! You will need to recreate/delete your INTERFACE targets. All others
# target types are OK. Repeat, ONLY INTERFACE TARGETS need to be recreated.
#
# Modified Defaults, Defaults.nortel, all plugins, genDevConfig
#  - Modified: standard-interface(-access, -hc, -access-hc)
#  - Modified: extended-interface(-access, -hc, -access-hc)
#  - Modified: cisco-interface(-access, -hc, -access-hc, -core, -core-hc)
#  - Modified: nortel-interface
#   The targets have changed. (I omit the ifOut.. to make this readable)
#   Added to all : ifInNUcastpkts
#   Added to all -hc : ifHCInUcastpkts, ifHCInBroadcastpkts, ifHCInMulticastPkts
#   Enabled extended-interface stats based on dot3stats mib.
#   Replaced nortel-interface with extended-interface.

#   Modified behaviour in genDevConfig and plugins so that --vendorint will
#   activate req_vendorint *and* req_extendedint *and* extendedint. In each
#   plugin, only one of the two must activated. So the onus is on the plugin
#   designers to deactivate extendedint if they use xxxxint(ie. ciscoint,
#   juniperint, etc.).

# Modified genDevConfig
#  - Deprecated -r, --rtragents, --nounused, -f, --framestats. They
#  are replaced with --nortragents, --noframestats and --showunused. Makes it
#  so that out fo the box it is running with the recommended options.

18/02/2005 - Integrated by Francois Mikus

# Version 2_0_0beta8

# Modified CiscoIOS
#  (sergey eremenko, s.eremenko @ rtcomm-yug . ru )
#  - Modified Cisco 1900 catalyst device type to use standard interface
#    as it does not support cisco-interface type.

17/02/2005 - Integrated by Francois Mikus

# Version 2_0_0beta7

# Modified Defaults and CiscoIOS
#  (Greg Cockburn, gcockburn @ tedis . com . au)
#  - Added Cisco 800 router device type
# Modified genDevConfig, CiscoIOS and CatalystOS
#  (Terje Bless)
#  - Added --modular option for hierarchical output of targets

21/12/2004 - Integrated by Francois Mikus

# Version 2_0_0beta6

# Modified genDevConfig
#  (Andrew Cutler, andrewc @ xtra . co . nz)
#  - Corrected missing squiggly }
# Modified CiscoIOS.pm
#  (Andrew Cutler, andrewc @ xtra . co . nz)
#  - Modified handling of IOS sysDescr string.
#  - Corrected syntax mistakes
#

20/12/2004 - Integrated by Francois Mikus

# Version 2_0_0beta5

# Modified genDevConfig
#  (Andrew Cutler, andrewc @ xtra . co . nz)
#  - Add missing ".0" to ipForwDatagrams OID.
#  - Set "$opts{collect} = 0" on Packeteer chassis (Stats !available via SNMP).
#  - Move handling of difficult ATM and Virtual interfaces to be 
#    proccessed with the rest.  Removed some types that are handled by 
#    speed and mtu tests. Had to add ATM Interleave Channel and BRI 
#    Bearer Channel interfaces as having "Channel" in @EXCEPTIONS is 
#    overriding @DONTCOLLECT (81 & 124).
#  - Created a new global $opts variable for having the max and max_octets
#    show up in the the target config. $opts{show_max}
#  - Exclude VOIP interfaces from having "rrd-max" and "rrd-max-octets" set.
#  - Exclude VOIP interfaces from speed and MTU tests.
#  - Cleanup to use logging instead of deprecated $moreverbose.


# Modified CiscoIOS.pm
#  (Andrew Cutler, andrewc @ xtra . co . nz)
# - Change IOS regex from '^C\d\d\d\d to '^C\d\d\d+ so 800 series 
#   routers will be collected.
# - Add missing dialCtlPeerCfgOriginateAddress definition.

# - Allow vlan collection on Catalyst 4000 switches with the string 
#   "Catalyst 4000" in the sysDescr for versions less than 12.2.
#   I have several working fine on 12.1.
# - Change primary $opts->{sysDescr} regex from /IOS/ to /IOS\s+\(tm\)/ 
#   or it will always match and the secondary regex will never be tried.
# - QOS fix to ignore multiple occurrences of "class-default" maps
#   in a Cisco QOS instance. Occurs because it is included by default
#   if a service policy is called in a class map. Cannot actually be disabled.
#   The duplicate instances were causing "unable to update rrd" errors.
# - Fixed QoS instances with trailing zeros to get lost due to quoting.
# - Fixed VOIP processing.
# - Corrected additional de-referencing for variables passed in %data hash
#   for custom_files sub.
# - Set $peerid = '' in several places to stop previous non-VOIP
#   interfaces being put in dialpeer targets file.
# - Remove '$customfile->close() || die "Cannot close $!";' or only the first
#   object makes it into the dialpeer targets file and "blessed reference"
#   errors are generated.


# Modified NortelAccelar.pm:
#  (Andrew Cutler, andrewc @ xtra . co . nz)
# - Fixed various references.


21/05/2004 - Integrated by Francois Mikus

# Version 2_0_0beta4

# Modified Defaults
#  (Karl Carsten, ckarl @ mpi-sb . mpg . de)
#  - Added a new target-type called extended statistics
#    Which will be used when no vendor specific extended statistics
#    are available and that extended statistics are required. This
#    target-types calls upon MIB-II interface statistics.
#  - Categorized the display of generic MIB-II extended
#    interface statistics
# Modified genDevConfig
#  (Karl Carsten, ckarl @ mpi-sb . mpg . de)
#  - Added an exception for insane speeds with Nortel 8xxx passports
#    This should eventually be removed and fixed in the nortel.pm
#    module itself. This is a hack for now.
# Added Nortel.pm
#  (Karl Carsten, ckarl @ mpi-sb . mpg . de)
#  - New module for passport 8x0x and accelar based switches
#    (Based on the code submitted for genRtrConfig and rewritten for
#    the new module format by Francois Mikus.)
# Modified Netscreen.pm
#  (Francois Mikus)
#  - Fixed a major bug, where the @config variable was not referenced back
#    to the main script in the correct format.
# Modified CiscoIOS.pm, JUNOS.pm, Netscreen.pm
#  (Francois Mikus)
#  - Text references to genRtrConfig were replaced with genDevConfig.

18/05/2004 - Integrated by Francois Mikus

# Version 2_0_0beta3

# Modified genDevConfig
#  (Francois Mikus)
#  - Modified MIB-II switch traffic stats to be used by all
#    network devices that support it. Not just the CiscoIOS devices
#    as was previously configured.
#  - Removed various bits of code and OIDs that were moved to CiscoIOS
#    and CatalystOS modules in previous versions.
#  - Various cosmetic changes to the code.
#  (cougar @ random . ee)
#  - removed Juniper (JUNOS) generic config
#  - @EXCEPTIONS handling changed (can use interface names also)
#  - collect ATM interface stats
#  - skip switch CPU interface
#  (Huw Lynch, huw_lynch @ yahoo . com)
#  - moved speed and speed_str calculation to after the calls to plugins to
#    allow the plugins to successfully override the values in the %speed hash.
#  - added ifOperStatus and ifAdminStatus to the list of info passed into
#    plugins. Required to decide if an interface with zero speed was 
#    actually up or not within a plugin. This is a fix for broken snmp
#    implentations.
#
# Modified CiscoIOS.pm, Defaults
#  (cougar @ random . ee)
#  - Added Catalyst 1900 series switches
#
# Added JUNOS.pm, Defaults.junos
#  (cougar @ random . ee)
#  - Juniper stats: CPU, memory, temperature, interfaces and firewall counters
#

01/04/2004 - Francois Mikus

# Version 2_0_0beta2

#    the custom_target function.
#  - Added customsdesc and customldesc for custom_interfaces
#  - Added processing of the custom*desc in creating the ldesc and sdesc
#  - Fixed interface type recognition for EXCEPTIONS
#  - Fixed value matching for --sortby, --communityrw options.
# Modified CiscoIOS.pm
#  - Added use of customldesc, customsdesc for dialpeers

#    - Added missing definitions for 12K, 7500 VIP CPU Stats 
#      (Thanks to Russell Heilling for the fixes)
#
# Modified genRtrConfig
#    - Fixed redundant declaration of hashes for VIP CPU stats
#    - Changed the name of the target-type for VIP CPU stats from cisco-cpu to cisco-vip-cpu
#    - Fixed invalid pattern match for recognizing VIP CPU Stats
#      (Thanks to Russell Heilling for the fixes)
#

23/06/2003 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_30-31
# 
# Modified genRtrConfig
#    - Added Nortel Contivity vpn tunnel support. There is a fudge in the selection
#      of the tunnel interface speed. It is currently statically assigned. Suggestions are
#      welcome. (Thanks to Stephen Muir)
#    - Added Cisco 12K, 75xx VIP CPU statistics (Thanks to ???, I can't find the email reference, sorry)
#    - Minor display corrections at high debugging modes
#    - Minor corrections to the --help information for examples on using --info option.
#    - Minor display correction to rate-limit CAR grapher display
#

05/05/2003 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_29
#
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#    - Added the Cisco Hardware serial numbers and chassis descriptions
#    - Fixed instances where a pointer to an Array was returned for a reverse IP lookup
#
#    Note: Please be advised that SAA FTP sourceip option is generally broken
#          in a lot of IOS versions. A lot of IOS versions are also broken in that
#          the FTP agent will run for a while then hang, and the process cannot be reset
#          unless you reboot. You need
#          to run 12.2.13b or higher. Some versions of 12.1(xx) can successfully
#          use the setting but they are pretty rare. ( 12.1(3)T , 12.2(13b), etc.) 
#          Of course be careful upgrading to new IOS versions, there is always something broken...
#

16/04/2003 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_28
#
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#    - Removed the refrence to Common::Log::setFormat('complete'); as this is not supported
#      yet by the Cricket module Common::Log. ;-)
#    - Added support for SAA FTP agents. The Defaults file has to be modified so that the
#      graphs display the right information. (Scaling & comments)
#

15/04/2003 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_26-27
#
#  Defaults file
#    - Now includes the Default file that was missing with version 1_5_23-25
#  
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#    - Fixed mapping for Catalyst Switches portNames.. Finally getting there.
#    - Now uses Cricket Log.pm with a default loglevel of 'warn'
#    - Removed --verbose and --moreverbose options, replaced by --loglevel <level>
#    - Requires a new version of Log.pm (For variable format logging)
#    - Removed --ciscoint option (Replaced by --vendorint option)
#    - Removed --pagergroup option (Replaced by --info option)
#    - Added --info option. This is a generic option used to store
#      arbitrary information in the Cricket config-tree
#      Usage:
#               --info "<key>:<value>"   (Quotes are optional)
#      Example:
#               --info "colour:blue"
#
#      target car
#         colour = blue
#

03/04/2003 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_23-25
#
#  Defaults file
#    - Now has support for ifName and mapping for Catalyst CatOS slot/port
#  
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#    - Fixed Cisco Catalyst CatOS Support which was horribly broken..
#      It will now collect chassis, and interface statistics
#    - Added option map() statement which will be device specific
#      currently only Catalyst CatOS devices will use the map(module-name)
#      mapping.
#      This should permit support of any device which has a single level
#      of interface mapping or multiple levels or any other funky way of
#      mapping interfaces.
#    - Added a totaly arbitrary value called sortby which can be added
#      to the config-tree for the device be created. This should be used
#      in scripts that extend Crickets functionality.
#    - Now supports order directive for all interfaces, so the interfaces
#      should now appear in a nice easy to read decreasing order.
#    - Fixed an issue with interfaces with 0 speed having the rrd-max set.
#      This may cause problems to people using the rrd-max value with a negative
#      rrd-min value. I will deal with the problem when it comes up. This should
#      be considered a patch. genRtrConfig does not currently support negative
#      values for rrd-min, nor does it accept or recognize dynamically the rrd-min.
#      It is currently hardcoded at 0. So until we support negative values, there
#      is no need to stretch our noodle.
#    - Replaced tabs with 4 spaces
#    - Removed trailing spaces
#
#  Modified the INSTALLATION notes
#   - Added more detailed information in sections that were unclear
#   - Corrected relations to files within the cricket config-tree

24/02/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_22
#
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#    - Replaced CiscoCatalyst... OID with portName OID from the Catalyst MIB which contains
#      the expected interface description.
#    - Added logic to replace the ifDescr for CatOS Catalyst ports to a "portSLOT_PORT" format
#      as the interface type is not very useful as a target name

24/02/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_21
#
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#    - Fixed a typo in the interface processing loop
#    - Added even more verbose processing information. Ugly in the code, but good enough
#      for now. Have to move to Cricket type error/debug/wrning/info type system in the future.
#      More likely for verion 2_x_x
#    - Added a new sysDescr string to match against Juniper Routers. This replaces the placeholder
#      that was put in at version 1_5_20. Should match different versions of the mXX series routers.
#      More sysDescr OID output would be nice though.

24/02/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_20
#
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#   - Added option -p or --ports to permit slot/port based exclusion lists. If the devices
#     Slot/Port mapping is supported, it will be matched against the comma delimited quoted
#     list provided by the user. 
#   - Added background code to support Slot/Port mapping on IOS and CatOS devices.
#   - Corrected Kevin Stewart's name in the documentation. doh.


24/02/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_19
#
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#   - Added option -n or --nodns to disable DNS Instance Address Mapping (Thanks to Kevin Stewart)
#   - Added DNS Resolution of router names to IP Adresses for informational purposes
#     this information is to be displayed in the web interface and included in the config-tree
#     under the chassis target ip => ip
#   - Added support for Cisco SAA RTR Agents for HTTP queries. These are automatically collected
#     Please note that a new config-tree is required.
#   - Fixed instance problem when no unique description is available for an interface.
#     Current method was totally useless. It now bases itself on the ifIndex number itself
#     to come up with a unique target name. See example with an Altiga VPN concentrator for
#     those that have such a device.
#   - Added support for Juniper MPLS Statistics (Thanks to Kevin Stewart)
#   - Added support for Cisco CAR Shaping Statistics (Thanks to Kevin Stewart)
#
#  Modified Defaults Config-Tree
#   - Added support for Cisco SAA RTR Agents using HTTP
#   - Added support for Juniper MPLS Statistics (Thanks to Kevin Stewart)
#   - Added support for Cisco CAR Shaping Statistics (Thanks to Kevin Stewart)
#
#  Modified the INSTALLATION notes
#   - Corrected some deprecated information for hard coded instances
#   - Added more detailed information in sections that were unclear


30/12/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_17-18
#
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#   - Added logic to avoid empty dialpeer directories (Thanks to Andrew Cutler)
#   - Added "order" directive to the chassis target to make sure it will always
#     be the first target displayed in the web interface 
#   - Added logic to automatically determine if ISL and 802.1Q sub-interface
#     stats are supported based on IOS version and other vendor versions. 
#     (Thanks to Andrew Cutler)
#   - Included recognition of ISL sub-interfaces in the interface processing
#     loop. (Andrew Cutler)
#   - Added logic to strip out the .0 sub-interface of an ATM interface,
#     as well as Virtual-Templates and Virtual-Access interfaces that are
#     not used to carry traffic. (Andrew Cutler)
#   - Fine tuned support for ifAlias for IOS versions greater or equal than 11.1
#     instead of 11.2. (Andrew Cutler)
#   - Modified the vlan processing logic to use the EXCEPTIONS list if --vlans
#     is used.
#   - Comments here and there..
#
#   - Modified how options are stored within genRtrConfig. They are now
#     contained in a global hash called %opts. All internal global variables
#     will now be stored within this hash. This will also facilitate passing
#     by reference options to external modules for device specific processing.
#
#     Old way:                 $framestats
#     New way:                 $opts{framestats}
#     From an external module: $opts->{framestats}
#
#   - Added a version subroutine version() that displays the genRtrConfig version information.
#   - Moved initial snmp contact to the subroutine contact()
#   - Consolidated some variable declarations ($file, $router, $snmp..)
#     Variables that were declared in the early part of the script.
#
#   Note: Always place the variable that will be receiving output from snmpUtil function
#         between (). Or else it will store the return value of 0(failure) or 1(success).

15/12/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_16
#
#  Modified genRtrConfig
#   - Fixed undefined statements when the description is not set. 
#     (Thanks to Manny Gonzales for identifying this one)
#

15/12/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_15
#
# Modified genRtrConfig
#  - Commented the changes I said I put in genRtrConfig_1_5_14. Totally my fault. Doh.
#    This the logic for treating the snmpv2c support I touted...
#  - Added a bypass for frame-relay sub-interfaces that do not have an mtu set.
#  - Added automatic detection of ifAlias *or* ifName for generic devices.

09/12/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_13-14 (snmpv2c support fixed for good and enhanced)
#
# Modified Defaults
#  - Added pix connections and memory operational block count
#  - Added Foundry specific support for chassis and interfaces *this should be tested*
#    (Thanks to John Deatherage)
#
# Modified genRtrConfig
#  - Activated interface type 53, virtual interfaces
#    exeception is vlans which are only activated if --vlans is specified
#  - Added some comments for snmpv2 interface logic
#  - Removed the --default-- logic for snmpv2c support
#    Which I now remember why I removed, which is *only*
#    query interfaces that require snmpv2c, for the rest use v1
#    as version 1 will be better supported across the range of products.
#    I replaced that logic with the one below..
#  - Added a logic test for snmpv2c counter support for interfaces.
#  - snmpv2c activation logic is now set to:
#      - Global snmpv2c $usev2c variable is non-zero
#      - A value is defined in the HC hash
#      - A non-zero value for the interface in the hash
#      - An interface speed of > 100Mbits
#    So if the test is successful, the interface will use a targetType
#    support HC counters and it will have an snmp-version '2c' tag in
#    the interface definition. Better support across the board and
#    more robust. :-)
#    (Thanks to Andrew Cutler for good feedback)
#
#    This is some of the most advanced snmpv2c detection available
# 
#  - Added a logic test for Generic Devices to see if they support MIB-II
#    ifAlias interface descriptions.

07/12/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_12 (back to imperfect snmpv2c support)
#
# Modified genRtrConfig
#  - Fixed an undefined error when calling genRtrConfig with no arguments
#  - Added a missing condition for smpv2c in the --default-- section
#    This should really fix the broken snmpv2c support which has 
#    been broken since 1_5_3.

06/12/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_11 (snmpv2c still broken)
#
# Modified genRtrConfig
#  - Fixed an undefined error when calling genRtrConfig with no arguments
#  - MAJOR BUG fixed, snmpv2c has been broken since genRtrConfig_1_5_3
#    a error in a variable name was causing all the trouble. Thank you once
#    again to Manny Gonzales for noticing the broken-ness.

03/12/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_9-10 (snmpv2c broken)

# Modified Defaults
#  - Added pixConnections OID
#  - Removed Cisco-Unknown-Router targetType
# 
# Modified genRtrConfig
#  - Fixed support for Cisco Serial interfaces that use time division with Frame-Relay interfaces
#  - Activated support for Cisco PIX connection statistics
#  - Fixed a logic bug for snmp queries that do not support SNMPv2c & that have a bad community
#    It would go on to try and create a config with nothing.. Now it exits cleanly with an error message.
#    sysObjectID contains 0 when the snmp community is invalid contrary to nothing when there is no response.
#  - Added CatOS Catalyst support for named interfaces
#    

02/12/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_7-8  (snmpv2c broken)

# Modified Defaults
#   - Added Cisco-1700-Router definition (same-as 1600)
#
# Modified genRtrConfig
#   - Reorganisation of target processing (much more streamlined)
#   - Reorganisation of default interface types
#   - Support for interface classification with all types of interfaces (cisco or standard or other)
#   - Fixed the collection on empty target types, Manny should be happy with this one. :-) No more error messages for targets with no known ds's.
#   - Preparation work to integrate foundry recognition (Not active yet)
#   - Preperation work for Cisco-pix-connection statistics (Not active yet)
#   - Removal of --ciscoint for more generic --vendorint (--ciscoint will still be supported for a while)
#   - Removal of --nodefault option. It is now always applied in the new
#     interface processing logic.
#   - Removed the Cisco-Unknown-Router target type. It was redundant.
#   
#   - Fixed Frame-Relay collection logic. The main interface was never
#     being collected as a full interface. It was always showing up as
#     a sub-interface. It will now be collected correctly.
#     (Thanks to Joe Nave for his help in troubleshooting and debugging)


27/11/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_6  (snmpv2c broken)

# Modified Defaults
#   - Added for support of Cisco-Generic-Router, which is are allowed(in genRtrConfig) to use snmpv2c.
#     Contrary to the Cisco-Unknown-Router targetType.
#
# Modified genRtrConfig
#
#   - Some debug information that was destined for -vv option was leaking in the general
#     output. This has been fixed. Additional debug should only happen when requested.
#   - Small logic bits with -vv options were touched up.
#   - Added recognition of RSP, L1010, C5RSM Cat IOS Routing Module. (Manny Gonzales)
#     No specific OIDs were added for these devices, only difference is that now they can
#     get queried using snmpv2c (if the IOS version supports it)

26/11/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_5  (snmpv2c broken)

# Modified the Defaults
#   - Added Wireless Bridge Association stats for Cisco Wireless bridges
# Modified genRtrConfig
#   - Added the -vv & --moreverbose options for enhanced verbose output.
#   - Added Wireless Bridge Associations for Cisco Wireless devices (Manny Gonzales)
#   - Added -m in addition to --monitors option
#   - Added -r in addition to --rtragents option
#   Internal code variable names for abstraction for generic vendor support

21/11/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Version 1_5_4  (snmpv2c broken)

# Modified the Defaults
#   - Added support for Generic-Device targetType in the Defaults (Manny Gonzales)
# Modified genRtrConfig
#   - Fixed support of --ciscoint MIB data which was being collected even when not asked for
#   - Removed the rra definitions for Cisco-7200-Router targetType (Thanks Manny)
#     This was causing some chassis collections to fail for those targetTypes (Thanks again Manny)
#   - More fun with Access Points, they *really* only support basic interfaces and a generic chassis
#     all advanced stuff is not promoted, wireless stats are as always ok. 
#   - Renamed chassitype variable to chassisname which is more exact in the sense
#     that this will be the actual name of the target "Chassis" in the targets file.
#
# Sorry for the shoddy QA on that release.. It was bound to screw up with all the changes.

20/11/2002 - Francois Mikus

# genRtrConfig_1_5_3 

# New in this version:
# (A lot of stuff been updated, if you develop stuff with genRtrConfig
# or would like to implement new features. Please upgrade to this code base.)
# 
# Major re-organisation of the code
#   - MUCH more generic processing of devices
#   - Cleaner comment structure
#   - More comments!!!
#   - Streamlined writetargets loop (removed device specific code)
#   - MAJOR change in processing logic for device identification
#   - Much more modular and generic approach for device and feature support

#   - Typos and minor comments were corrected
#   - Wireless bridge collection is now treated as a generic device with cisco interface stats
#     (if requested of course) until further notice.
# 
# New code feature
#   - Argument promotion
#     If a feature is requested such as "--framestats". It will only be activated
#     if the request "$req_framestats" is promoted by a device which supports it.
#     Then, and only then is the feature activated.
#     I am really proud of this feature, it makes it much easier to control what devices
#     support which user configured features. :-)
#
# Minor update to the INSTALLATION.genRtrConfig file. 
#   - Typos and comments

18/11/2002 - Francois Mikus

# genRtrConfig_1_5_2

# Added default logic to skip interfaces that are named starting with VLAN... 
# On my previous fix attempt, I was completly off-track, I still think
# iftype 53 should not be collected, but hey!)
# Added even more robust detection logic for Wireless Access Points and bridges
#   (Not sure about the stats for the bridge though. Feedback would be nice.)
# Changed the file permissions for the distribution. More restrictive.

14/11/2002 - Francois Mikus

# genRtrConfig_1_5_1

# Corrected an instance omission for vpn and wireless statistics

# Added generic Chassis support for non-cisco devices (Used for storing general values)
# Removed --core option from genRtrConfig, still too experimental
# Cleaned up and commented the Default config-tree associated with genRtrConfig

08/10/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Added support for Cisco-2950 IOS switches
# Added basic support within the config tree for Cisco Altiga VPN gateway. 


24/07/2002 - Francois Mikus

# Added support for Cisco Service Assurance Agents (SAA or RTR) of round-trip-type using the rtragents option
#    This requires additionnal target types to be defined in the cisco-routers config-tree
#
# Bug fix for basic PIX recognition and support (The PIX regex was faulty)
#
# A new config-tree definition for cisco-routers/Defaults is required to use the new fonctionality

#    Added logic to apply the monitor thresholds during writing out of the configuration file
#    Added new --core, --access, --accessuser options for applying interface types
#    Added a --nodef option to force a full write out of interface types in the targets files instead of relying on the default entry. This is necessary to apply monitor thresholds to standard interfaces
# Added a calculation for converting the max interface speed to max-octets to the config-tree for each interface
# Added support for 1600, 2500, 3000, 4500 routers and terminal servers

# Added intelligence in determining what routers support correctly SNMP V2c HC counters based on router type
#
# Added support for Holt-Winter algorithm on specific router types and interface types
#
# A new config-tree definition for cisco-routers/Defaults is required to use the new fonctionality
